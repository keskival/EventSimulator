simulate.py runs a factory simulation and outputs the input data for CURRENNT
application in netCDF4 format to test.nc.

config.cfg configures the network to be trained.

validation.nc and train.nc are similar files to test.nc, but created independently
with the same simulate.py script.

run.sh runs the network training and outputs trained_network.jsn.
